Aquarius is a source code processing tool.  Given an
ambiguous\footnote{with certain restrictions} EBNF description of a
language, Aquarius can parse it.  Adding layout rules allows Aquarius
to format it, for pretty-printing or editing.  Adding semantic rules
lets Aquarius check it for errors.  Finally, adding some abstract
coding rules allows Aquarius to generate code for a wide variety of
architectures, ranging from the 6502/6510, through the PDP-11, i386
and x86\_64.
