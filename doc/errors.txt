1. Multiple private withs

This works:
  private with P;
  package Test is ...

This doesn't:
  private with P;
  private with Q;
  package Test is ...

The problem is that the private keyword is ambiguous, since it can
also be part of a private package declaration:

  private with P;
  private package Test is ..

A single private with works because of some extra special ambiguity
processing.

2. Loop variables not declared

Using a loop variable in the body of the loop generates an error:

   for I in 1 .. 10 loop
      Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Integer'Image (I));
   end loop;

generates

   "I" is undefined

3. Error when package has no body, even if it doesn't need one.

For example, the following package spec:

   package P is
   end P;

does not need a body; indeed the language definition forbids one.
Aquarius doesn't know about this, so it complains about the missing
body.
