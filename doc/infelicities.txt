1. Bad location for new lines chosen.

Example:

   type Root_Agent_Type is abstract
     new Grendel.Objects.
         Root_Named_Object and Grendel.
                               Stock.
                               Stocker_Interface and Grendel.Markets.Client_Interface with private;

Aquarius should not insert new lines unless there can be a space at that position.

2. Linked formatting.

Example:

   function Last_Income
     (Agent : Root_Agent_Type) return Money.Money_Type;

If there's a new line inserted after Last_Income, there should also be
one before the return keyword.

I do not have a generic rule for this.

3. Lining up symbols

Example:

   procedure Set_Need (Agent : in out Root_Agent_Type;
                       Item : in Grendel.Commodities.Commodity_Type;
                       Level : in Need_Level;
                       Quantity : in Quantities.Quantity);

The colons should be aligned vertically.

We can say that matching subtrees in a repeater should be aligned,
leading to this result:

   procedure Set_Need (Agent    : in out Root_Agent_Type;
                       Item     : in Grendel.Commodities.Commodity_Type;
                       Level    : in Need_Level;
                       Quantity : in Quantities.Quantity);

Align token if:
  - token is a terminal
  - token is not at the end of the line
  - token is a direct child of the repeater
